# BreastMassMalignancy

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a breast mass is benign or malignant using a dataset of 569 observations extracted through Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). The dataset includes 30 primary features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, points, symmetry, and dimension of the breast mass. The dataset used in this project can be accessed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It contains 569 observations with 31 columns (30 features and 1 target column). The target column indicates the type of breast mass ('B' for benign and 'M' for malignant).

In the data preprocessing phase, we checked for duplicates and missing values, dropped unnecessary features, and removed highly correlated features to prevent overfitting. We corrected skewness using logarithmic transformation, scaled the data, and removed outliers defined as data points beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean. Finally, we encoded the target column, with 'B' as 0 and 'M' as 1, for binary classification.

In the model development phase, we used logistic regression and split the dataset into an 80-20 train-test ratio. Two models were trained: one using logarithmically transformed data and another using non-transformed data. Both models performed excellently, with the non-transformed model achieving a slightly higher F1-score of 0.9697 compared to the transformed model's 0.9640, demonstrating strong accuracy in predicting breast mass malignancy.

This project successfully developed two logistic regression models to predict breast mass malignancy, with the non-transformed dataset model slightly outperforming the transformed dataset model. Both models achieved high accuracy, demonstrating their effectiveness in classifying breast masses as benign or malignant. The project is thoroughly documented in this [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15rd4bqo1peCzsIeEMJnSoz5lrHg6GO2x/view?usp=sharing), providing detailed insights into the methodology, preprocessing steps, and model performance.
